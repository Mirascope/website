LangSmith is a popular observability and evaluation platform for LLM applications. It helps you debug, test, and monitor performance with features like tracing, prompt versioning, and a playground for experimenting with prompts and chains. 

It’s especially useful for tracking changes and helping you understand how your app behaves across different runs. 

But LangSmith has some limitations:

* It typically versions only the prompt templates, but not the surrounding code, logic, or the callable function that makes the LLM call. This can make tracing the root cause of issues difficult when things go wrong.     
* Linking an output back to the exact prompt version requires you to manually save changes as new commits.    
* LangSmith is tightly integrated with LangChain, and its tracing and versioning features work best within that ecosystem. If you’re building with tools outside LangChain, you’ll need to manually instrument your code using their SDK or API to capture traces and versions.  
* Some users find the UI to be complex to navigate, and evals are also intricate, sometimes requiring large datasets.

In this article, we cover nine alternatives to LangSmith, starting with [Lilypad](/docs/lilypad), our open-source framework for tracking, debugging, and optimizing LLM applications.

## 1. Lillypad: Full-Code Snapshot Versioning for Reproducible LLM Development

![Lilypad Homepage](/assets/blog/langsmith-alternatives/lilypad-homepage.webp)

[Lilypad](/docs/lilypad) is built for software developers and lets them run their LLM workflows with the same structure and reliability as real code. It approaches prompt engineering as an optimization problem, recognizing that LLM calls are inherently non-deterministic and that even small adjustments can have unpredictable effects on the output.  

To manage this unpredictability, Lilypad doesn't just track prompts, but captures the entire function closure. This means it versions everything that could influence the LLM call's outcome, including the function being called, all relevant model settings, parameters, helper functions, and any logic within scope.   

This creates a full snapshot of the code context behind each output, making it easier to trace what changed, reproduce results, and experiment methodically when building [LLM applications](/blog/llm-applications).

Lilypad is also lightweight, works with other [LLM frameworks](/blog/llm-frameworks), and can be used with any prompt engineering library or provider SDK. If you prefer to self-host, you can run Lilypad with just Python 3.10+, PostgreSQL, Docker, and a GitHub or Google account for login. No complex setup or vendor lock-in. 

Below are some of Lilypad’s core features that help make prompt development easier, less error-prone, and more efficient for developers. 

### Make Your LLM Code Easy to Track 

Lilypad helps you keep your LLM code clean and organized by wrapping each LLM call in a regular Python function. That function holds everything you need: inputs, prompt, model settings, logic, and even any pre- or post-processing steps.

By keeping it all in one place, you can trace exactly what happened, spot what changed, and keep the LLM stuff separate from the rest of your app. It’s easier to debug, test, and improve.

To enable tracing, simply add the @lilypad.trace decorator and set `versioning=”automatic"`. This tells Lilypad that the function contains an LLM call (or other non-deterministic code, e.g., retrieval from vector databases or embeddings), and that they should be automatically versioned and traced every time the code is run:  

```python
from google.genai import Client
import lilypad

lilypad.configure(auto_llm=True)
client = Client()
    
@lilypad.trace(versioning="automatic")  # [!code highlight]
def answer_question(question: str) -> str | None:
    response = client.models.generate_content(
        model="gemini-2.0-flash-001",
        contents=f"Answer this question: {question}",
    )
    return response.text
    
response = answer_question("What is the capital of France?")  # automatically versioned
print(response)
# > The capital of France is Paris.   
```

This creates a nested trace and logs that function execution as version 1 in the Lilypad playground:

![Answer Qustion Version 1 Trace](/assets/blog/langsmith-alternatives/answer-question-trace.webp)

If you update the function (even slightly), Lilypad automatically creates version 2  and logs it.    

![Answer Question Version 2](/assets/blog/langsmith-alternatives/answer-question-v2.webp)

You can also compare function versions by clicking the “Compare” button:  

![Answer Question Click Compare](/assets/blog/langsmith-alternatives/answer-question-click-compare.webp)

This toggles a second dropdown menu, where you can select another version and view the differences side-by-side.  

![Answer Question Compare Versions](/assets/blog/langsmith-alternatives/answer-question-compare-versions.webp)

For better observability, Lilypad instruments everything using the [OpenTelemetry Gen AI spec](https://opentelemetry.io/).

Each trace breaks down the full story: what was asked, how it was asked, and what came back. It’s perfect for debugging and improving tricky workflows. You also get all the key details: inputs, outputs, model and provider info, token usage, latency, and cost.

![Answer Question GenAI OTel Trace Data](/assets/blog/langsmith-alternatives/answer-question-genai-data.webp)

This kind of automatic tracing and version control lets you easily measure improvements and iterate without guessing what was different between runs.    

Lilypad also detects when a function (and its prompts) haven’t changed, so it won't create duplicate versions unnecessarily.

### Collaborating with Non-Technical Experts  

Lilypad’s no-code playground supports collaboration across technical and non-technical teams. 

This lets non-developers interact with and tweak prompts directly, without touching code or depending on engineers for minor changes.   

It also separates concerns, allowing software engineers to focus on system architecture while SMEs handle prompt logic and evaluation. 

![Answer Question Playground](/assets/blog/langsmith-alternatives/answer-question-playground.webp)

The dashboard provides Markdown-supported prompt templates with type-safe variables, along with their associated Python functions, so you can see both the prompt and the exact code it ties into. 

It also shows:

* LLM outputs and traces.   
* Call settings, such as provider, model, temperature, and other configuration details.  
* Metadata, including cost, token usage, and latency, to help monitor efficiency and performance.

### Evaluating LLM Outputs 

Since LLMs are non-deterministic, evaluating their outputs is challenging: you can run the same prompt twice and get slightly different (yet valid) outputs. That makes traditional testing methods like unit tests less reliable since you can’t always count on exact matches. Plus, what qualifies as “correct” often depends on context.

Lilypad tackles this challenge in two ways. First, it logs every detail of a call, including inputs, outputs, costs, and timing, to give you a complete, traceable picture of how an LLM behaves over time. This persistent context makes it easier to rate outputs consistently, spot regressions, and understand how changes in prompts or code affect the results.

And unlike LangSmith, which depends on pre-built datasets for [prompt evaluation](/blog/prompt-evaluation), Lilypad takes a trace-first approach, turning every prompt run into a versioned trace with full metadata and building a real-world dataset automatically as you go. This means when outputs vary (as they often do), you have the full context to understand what changed. 

This is shown in the playground, where you see which version of the code and [LLM prompt](/blog/llm-prompt) produced each output and find patterns in what works (and what doesn’t), and test if a new version actually performs better on the same input. It’s not just trial and error anymore; prompt engineering becomes a real optimization process for [LLM integration](/blog/llm-integration).

Secondly, because “correctness” often involves subjective judgment or fuzzy criteria, especially in tasks like summarization or reasoning where there’s no single "correct" output, Lilypad simplifies the evaluation process into a pass/fail labeling system. Instead of agonizing over granular scoring (like 1-5 ratings) or trying to match exact strings, you just ask: Is this output acceptable? This keeps evaluations focused, fast, and practical, even across thousands of traces. 

The playground also lets you easily select any output for annotation: 

![Answer Question Assign Annotation](/assets/blog/langsmith-alternatives/answer-question-assign-annotation.webp)  

From there, just click the “Pass” or “Fail” label, add any context or reasoning if you want, and click “submit annotation.”   

![Answer Question Submit Annotation](/assets/blog/langsmith-alternatives/answer-question-submit-annotation.webp)

We encourage users to manually label outputs, especially early in a project. Because each label is tied to a specific versioned output, it helps build high-quality, human-annotated datasets that can later be used to train automated evaluation systems, such as LLM judges, which we plan to launch soon.    

The goal is to move from manual labeling to semi-automated evaluation where an [LLM-as-judge](/blog/llm-as-judge) proposes labels, and a human evaluator verifies or rejects them. This works well since verifying is usually faster than creating from scratch.   

Nonetheless, even with automated methods, keeping a human in the loop for final verification is advised, as automated systems (no matter how good) can still miss things that only a human can properly judge.

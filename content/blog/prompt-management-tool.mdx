Prompt management helps teams version, evaluate, and track changes to prompts so they can iterate easily when building LLM applications.

In this post, we’ll cover five leading tools, with an in-depth look at our open source framework, [Lilypad](/docs/lilypad).

Lilypad treats prompts like full-fledged code artifacts, versioning not only the text itself but also the logic, model parameters, and structured outputs that shape an LLM’s behavior. This makes it easy to debug behavior, compare outputs, and collaborate across teams while keeping track of what changed and why.

The five prompt management tools we’ll compare are:

1. [Lilypad](#1-lilypad-full-context-prompt-management-for-llm-workflows)
2. [Langsmith](#2-langsmith-prompt-management-inside-the-langchain-ecosystem)
3. [Langfuse](#3-langfuse-open-sourced-control-over-your-prompt-lifecycle)
4. [Agenta](#4-agenta-a-self-hostable-platform-for-versioning-testing-and-evaluating-prompts)
5. [PromptLayer](#5-promptlayer-a-visual-workspace-for-prompt-versioning-and-testing)

## How to Choose a Prompt Management Tool

Anyone who’s worked with stochastic LLMs knows how unpredictable they can be. Even tiny changes in wording can lead to different results that can become impossible to reproduce without proper versioning and tracing.

That’s where prompt management tools come in; they (in some aspects) focus on observability and give teams the structure to organize, track, and improve prompts across their lifecycle.

In this sense, prompt management complements prompt engineering: while engineering is about designing the right inputs to guide LLMs, management ensures those inputs are systematically tested, tracked, and refined over time.

We recommend you look for a tool that:

### Tracks and Versions *Every* Prompt Change

Versioning and tracing allow you to treat prompting like real software development rather than as trial-and-error guesswork because it preserves the history of changes and records what actually happened on each run.

At the very least, a good tool allows you to select and save a given prompt change, which is useful since it lets you run controlled experiments without losing track of what worked before.

But having to manually save changes introduces some friction while ideally you shouldn’t *have* to think about what to save. An advanced tool will just save all your changes automatically while you focus on [prompt optimization](/blog/prompt-optimization).

A strong versioning system also links each prompt to not only metadata like model type, version, and parameters, but also to its surrounding context like the execution flow around the LLM call, its input formatting, and any downstream validation steps. All this creates an auditable trail that supports debugging and compliance.

### Allows Technical and Non-Technical Teams to Collaborate

Having a space where domain experts can separately iterate on prompts without involving developers lets them experiment faster without needing to change or redeploy the code. 

Basic requirements for such a space are:

* Clear visibility into prompt history, versions, and related metadata.  
* Role-based access control with granular permissions for developer, domain expert, and reviewer roles.  
* A no-code editing environment for non-technical users.  
* The capability to preview and test prompt changes instantly.  
* Support for prompt templates with input variables.

An advanced system also works with existing version control systems like Git or CI/CD pipelines so developers can automate testing and deployment while non-technical contributors safely make updates.

### Enables Systematic Testing, Validation, and Side-by-Side Prompt Comparisons

One of the hardest aspects of [advanced prompt engineering](/blog/advanced-prompt-engineering) is knowing whether a change actually improved performance. This is where a good prompt management tool helps: by making it easy to test, compare, and monitor prompts throughout their lifecycle, teams can reliably identify, improve, and maintain the best-performing prompts.

It provides a live experimentation environment to adjust prompts and instantly see output changes, so you can fine-tune parameters and iterate quickly without redeploying code.

It should also allow you to directly compare outputs from different prompt versions or large language models (especially side-by-side) to identify performance differences to iterate effectively.

Users can then annotate and evaluate outputs accordingly, creating a permanent, searchable feedback history. Validating and labeling outputs in this way also strengthens the dataset for comparing different versions and detecting regressions.

Advanced systems also let users collaboratively evaluate prompts against predefined criteria like relevance, accuracy, consistency, and readability. To make evaluations easier at scale, some tools provide automated scoring and the ability to compare outputs against reference answers.

## Five Leading Tools for Prompt Management

### 1. Lilypad: Full-Context Prompt Management for LLM Workflows

![Lilypad Landing Page](/assets/blog/prompt-management-tool/lilypad-landing-page.webp)

[Lilypad](/docs/lilypad) approaches prompt engineering as an optimization problem, applying proven software engineering practices to LLM application development. It allows users to version, trace, and optimize workflows by capturing the full context of every LLM interaction.

Instead of treating prompts as disconnected text assets, Lilypad treats them as part of version-controlled functions. This lets users debug, measure, and improve everything that influences outputs.

Below, we break down key Lilypad prompt management and observability capabilities that help teams version, trace, and continuously improve their LLM workflows.

#### Capturing the Full Story Behind Every LLM Call

To record the full context of a prompt, Lilypad encourages users to wrap the prompt, the LLM call, and any surrounding code in a Python function. This snapshots everything that influences the call's outcome, including:

* Input arguments, such as the user query or chat history  
* LLM model settings  
* Any pre- or post-processing steps and helper functions  
* The code logic within the function's scope

Everything within the function’s closure effectively becomes the prompt, rather than just the prompt instruction.

You decorate the function with `@lilypad.trace(versioning="automatic")`, which automatically versions any changes within the function’s closure, creating a complete record of the prompt and its context. With this, all conditions that led to a specific output are preserved, so you can replay it exactly as it occurred.

In addition, you can automatically trace all API-level metadata across your codebase by adding a single line: `lilypad.configure(auto_llm=True)`. This captures key metadata about calls like inputs, outputs, token usage, cost, and latency (even for calls outside decorated functions but that are still within the function closure).

```python
from openai import OpenAI
import lilypad

lilypad.configure(auto_llm=True)  # [!code highlight]
client = OpenAI()
    
@lilypad.trace(versioning="automatic")  # [!code highlight]
def answer_question(question: str) -> str:
    resp = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": f"Answer this question: {question}"}],
    )
    return resp.choices[0].message.content

answer = answer_question("Who painted the Mona Lisa?") # automatically versioned
print(answer)
# > The Mona Lisa was painted by the Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci. 
```

All this offers a complete audit trail of what changed and why (not only in the prompt but in the prompt’s context). Incremented versions are shown in the Lilypad UI:

![Lilypad Trace View](/assets/blog/prompt-management-tool/lilypad-trace-view.webp)

It even logs and tracks changes to user-defined functions or classes outside the main prompt function as long as these are within the decorated function’s scope.

The “Compare” button in the Lilypad UI allows you to see the differences between various versions of the code:

![Lilypad Click Compare](/assets/blog/prompt-management-tool/lilypad-click-compare.webp)

Clicking this displays a second dropdown menu, where you can select another version and view the differences side-by-side:

![Lilypad Compare Verisons](/assets/blog/prompt-management-tool/lilypad-compare-versions.webp)

The UI also lets you inspect trace data for any LLM call in a function in order to see the full picture of what happened during the run, including any changes to inputs, logic, prompt changes, and model settings: 

![Lilypad Trace Data](/assets/blog/prompt-management-tool/lilypad-trace-data.webp)

Downstream, you can use the `.version` method to compare outputs, track changes, or reproduce earlier results.

```python
response = answer_question.version(4)("Who painted the Mona Lisa?")
```

This returns type-safe function signatures that match the expected arguments for that specific version and also provides type hints for your IDE.

#### A Workspace That Keeps Prompts in Sync With Your Code

Lilypad’s no-code UI gives users a place to collaborate on prompts, with every change linked directly back to the underlying code.

Under the hood, Lilypad ensures prompt edits stay in sync with the exact type-safe Python code that developers run downstream. That means what you test in the workspace is exactly what’s in the codebase, which avoids the brittleness of other systems where prompts live separately.

Unlike tools that only version the text of a prompt, Lilypad versions the code itself. Every change, whether a change of wording or a parameter adjustment, creates a new version of the underlying function.

The Lilypad playground supports markdown-based editing with typed variable placeholders, which helps prevent common errors like missing values, incorrect formats, or injection vulnerabilities.

Users can also directly adjust model settings like temperature or `top_p`. Together, these features ensure all prompt edits remain consistent, traceable, and fully integrated into the application’s codebase.

#### Building Reliable Evaluation Pipelines

Lilypad allows teams to annotate LLM outputs to track evaluation decisions alongside version history, trace data, and prompt changes.

Every review is tied to the exact function version, inputs, prompt text, and model settings that produced the output. This means teams can always see why a prompt behaved the way it did and recreate those conditions if needed.

But evaluation goes beyond checking if an answer is right or wrong. In many real-world cases, the goal is to decide whether an output is “good enough” for the intended use. For this, human judgment often plays a central role. 

For example, on a 1–5 scale, one reviewer might rate a response a 3 while another rates it a 4, showing how subjective judgment can shape evaluations even when both reviewers agree the output is usable.

Because of this subjectivity, evaluation tools need a structured way to capture and organize feedback. The Lilypad UI lets teams assign outputs to specific reviewers to turn individual judgments into structured data.

The outputs to evaluate appear in structured queues, where reviewers can label them as pass or fail and add reasoning notes. To reduce bias, existing annotations remain hidden until the review is complete.

![Lilypad Annotation Queue](/assets/blog/prompt-management-tool/lilypad-annotation-queue.webp)

The result is a body of searchable evaluation data stored alongside trace details and version history, making reviews easy to audit and reproduce.

Developers can set `mode="wrap"` in `@lilypad.trace` to make the function’s return value annotatable through `.annotate()`. This makes it easy to add annotations in code, integrate automated checks, or plug evaluations into CI/CD pipelines without needing to switch to the UI.

```python
from google.genai import Client
import lilypad

client = Client()
lilypad.configure()

@lilypad.trace(name="Answer Question", versioning="automatic", mode="wrap")  # [!code highlight]
def answer_question(question: str) -> str | None:
    response = client.models.generate_content(
        model="gemini-2.0-flash-001",
        contents=f"Answer this question: {question}",
    )
    return response.text

trace: lilypad.Trace[str | None] = answer_question("Who painted the Mona Lisa?")
print(trace.response)  # original response
# > The Mona Lisa was painted by the Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci.. 

annotation = lilypad.Annotation(  # [!code highlight]
    label="pass",  # [!code highlight]
    reasoning="The answer was correct",  # [!code highlight]
    data=None,  # [!code highlight]
    type=None,  # [!code highlight]
)  # [!code highlight]
trace.annotate(annotation)  # [!code highlight]
```

We believe having humans evaluate outputs creates solid datasets for accurate automation later on, via methods like [LLM-as-a-judge](/blog/llm-as-judge), which reduces manual labeling workload by eventually shifting humans into a verification role.

Nonetheless we encourage manual spot-checking to catch more subtle errors that automated judging might miss

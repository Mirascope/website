# Cost & Latency

Lilypad automatically captures the latency of every span. For spans containing LLM API calls, Lilypad also automatically captures the cost of that call.

## Trace View

When you select a trace to view more details, you'll find the latency of the span in the top right corner:

If the span is or contains an LLM call, there will also be a pill for cost.

## Project Dashboard

The home page for each project acts as a dashboard overview of the project.

You can see cost and latency charts amongst other stats:

## Versioned Function Dashboard

The main page for a versioned function will show you cost and latency charts at the top:

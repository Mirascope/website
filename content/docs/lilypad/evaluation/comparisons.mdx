# Comparisons

Comparisons are a core to any evaluation process. Lilypad provides a simple way to compare spans and versioned functions.

## Comparing Spans

You can compare spans by selecting the two spans you want to compare and clicking the "Compare" button.

This will open the comparison view, which shows you the two spans side by side:

## Comparing Function Versions

In the versioned function view, you can click the "Compare" button to toggle a second version dropdown:

# Versioning

> If you haven't already, we recommend reading [Traces](/docs/lilypad/observability/traces) first.

When working with non-determinism (cough cough LLMs), it's extremely important that we take a snapshot of the exact version of the code that was used to produce an output. This reproducibility is necessary for proper [evaluation](/docs/lilypad/evaluation).

## Automatic Versioning

Setting `versioning="automatic"` will tell Lilypad to automatically version the decorated function every time it's executed:

```python
from google.genai import Client
import lilypad

lilypad.configure(auto_llm=True)
client = Client()
    
@lilypad.trace(versioning="automatic")  # [!code highlight]
def answer_question(question: str) -> str | None:
    response = client.models.generate_content(
        model="gemini-2.0-flash-001",
        contents=f"Answer this question: {question}",
    )
    return response.text
    
response = answer_question("What is the capital of France?")  # automatically versioned
print(response.content)
# > The capital of France is Paris.
```

<Success>
**The version is the "runnable closure" snapshot**

Whenever you run a `trace`-decorated function with `versioning="automatic"`, we compute the entire code execution graph necessary to reproduce the current execution of the function.

_This is what we use to determine the version._

This means that changing the code to an existing version will automatically attach the trace to that version.

It also means that changes to anything that would change how the function is executed will be captured:

```python
# This function will be included in the version and any changes
# to it will result in a new version of `answer_question`
def answer_question_prompt(question: str) -> str:  # [!code highlight]
    return f"Answer this question: {question}"  # [!code highlight]

@lilypad.trace(name="Answer Question", versioning="automatic") 
def answer_question(question: str) -> str | None:
    response = client.models.generate_content(
        model="gemini-2.0-flash-001",
        contents=answer_question_prompt(question),  # [!code highlight]
    )
    return response.text
```
</Success>

## Version Override

Since a function's version is a snapshot, we can re-run the exact code for a given version.

First, generate type-safe stubs for all available versions:

```bash
lilypad sync
```

This ensures that the `.version` method return type-safe function signatures matching the expected arguments for that version, which you can then run in a sandbox:

```python
response = answer_question.version(1)("What is the capital of France?")
```

### A/B Testing

You can use the `.version` method to run different versions of the same function easily. This makes A/B testing quite easy â€” just run each version for a subset of users and evaluate which one is better.

# mirascope.core.base.call_params

## `BaseCallParams`
<Note title="Base Class Definition">
This class is simply a means of binding type variables to ensure they are call params, but the class itself is empty. We do this because you cannot bind a type variable to a base `TypedDict` type and must create your own subclass to do so.
</Note>
## <ApiType type="Class" module="mirascope.core.base.call_params" path="core/base/call_params" symbolName="BaseCallParams" /> BaseCallParams

**Bases:** TypedDict

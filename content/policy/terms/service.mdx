    2.7. **Documentation.** Customer may copy and use (and permit the Authorized Users to
    copy and use) the Documentation solely in connection with the use of the Platform under
    this Agreement.   

    2.8. **Third-Party Items.** The Platform may include, or be dependent on, certain
    third-party data, open source software components, application programming interfaces,
    and other items (the "**Third-Party Items**"). Third-Party Items shall not include any

     Mirascope will ensure that it at all times maintains all rights and licenses in and
     to the Third-Party Items that are necessary to ensure that Customer and its Authorized
     Users can use the Platform in the manner contemplated in this Agreement.   Mirascope
     will provide support for the Third-Party Items in the same manner and scope for which
     it provides support for the Platform hereunder.   MIRASCOPE, NOT BEING THE OWNER,
     OPERATOR, SUPPLIER, OR PRODUCER OF THE THIRD-PARTY ITEMS NOR THEIR AGENT, DOES NOT
     ENDORSE ANY THIRD-PARTY ITEMS, AND MAKES NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF ANY KIND
     WHATSOEVER WITH RESPECT TO THE THIRD-PARTY ITEMS AND DISCLAIMS ANY SUCH WARRANTIES
     THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE EXIST. 

    2.9. **Third-Party AI Models.** The Platform may use Third-Party AI Models to provide
    the AI features and functionality. You acknowledge and understand that your use of such
    AI features and functionality will be governed by the terms and conditions of third
    parties that provide such Third-Party AI Models
    ("**Third-Party AI Models Terms and Conditions**") and your Input may be used by such
    third parties in accordance with such Third-Party AI Models Terms and Conditions. 
    Mirascope has no control over the use of the Input, thus, any use of such is at your
    own risk and Mirascope does not represent, undertake or warrant to any security or
    control of or to the Input. 

    2.10. **Onboarding of Authorized Users.** Each Authorized User will be required to create

    identity when he or she logs into the Platform in the future (collectively,
    "**Log-in Credentials**"). When creating an account, an Authorized User must provide
    true, accurate, current, and complete information.  You are solely responsible for the
    confidentiality and use of Authorized Users’ Log-in Credentials, as well as for any use,
    misuse, or communications entered through the Software.  You shall promptly inform us of
    any need to deactivate a username, password, or other Log-in Credential.  We reserve the

    reason.  We will not be liable for any unauthorized use of an Authorized User’s account. 

    2.11. **Support Services.** Mirascope shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
    provide you and your Authorized Users problem resolution and technical support in
    connection with the Platform during the Subscription Term (the "**Support Services**").
    In order to provide Support Services for Self-Hosted SaaS Solution, Mirascope may require
    access to your instance of Self-Hosted SaaS Solution in order to debug and resolve any
    issues you may encounter. Such access is enabled by default, but you may opt-out by
    disabling it from the "Settings" of the Self-Hosted SaaS Solution. By disabling the
    access, you understand and agree that you may not be able to receive all the benefits
    of the Support Services provided by  Mirascope under this Agreement. 

    2.12. **Hosting the  Mirascope Hosted SaaS Solution.** During the Subscription Term,
    we, or our contractors, shall host the  Mirascope Hosted SaaS Solution, such that the
    Mirascope Hosted SaaS Solution is available for use by your Authorized Users. We
    and/or our contractors shall periodically monitor the  Mirascope Hosted SaaS Solution
    to optimize performance, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any
    downtime, other than for scheduled maintenance or downtime caused by reasons beyond our
    reasonable control, including, but not limited to, acts of God, acts of any governmental
    body, war, insurrection, sabotage, armed conflict, terrorism, embargo, fire, flood,
    strike or other labor disturbance, unavailability of or interruption or delay in
    telecommunications or third-party services, or virus attacks or hackers. We will use
    commercially reasonable efforts to notify you of any unavailability or other issue
    with the  Mirascope Hosted SaaS Solution. You and your Authorized Users will be
    responsible for obtaining Internet connections and other third-party software and
    services necessary for them to access the  Mirascope Hosted SaaS Solution.  

    2.13. **Overage.** At any time during the Subscription Term, if Customer usage exceeds
    its subscription plan ("**Overage**"), Customer will correct the Overage by purchasing
    additional licenses within fifteen (15) days of the Overage. If Customer does not
    purchase licenses for the Overage within such fifteen (15) day period, Mirascope may
    suspend Customer’s use of the Platform by providing five (5) days prior notice. Customer
    agrees (i) that Mirascope may access to view Self-Hosted SaaS Solution and (ii) to
    provide Mirascope with all information reasonably required for the purpose of verifying
    Customer’s compliance with subscription plan usage, which may be in the form of a formal
    certification. 

    2.14. **Privacy Policy.** Your use of the Platform may involve the transmission to us
    of certain personal information. Our policies with respect to the collection and use of
    such personal information are governed according to our Privacy Policy, located at

    3.2. **Input and Output.** Customer is solely responsible for ensuring that the Input

    and functionality of the Platform may generate the same or similar Output for different
    users or third parties. 

    3.3. **Aggregated Data.** Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, we may use,
    and may permit our third-party service providers to access and use, the Customer Data,

    improving our products and services including the Platform. Aggregate Data does not

    that we may collect, use, publish, disseminate, sell, transfer, and otherwise exploit
    such Aggregate Data.

    3.4. **Data Security.**  We (and any third-party hosting provider that we may engage)

    to secure the Customer Data in the  Mirascope Hosted SaaS Solution, from unauthorized
    use or disclosure. You acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for implementing
    and maintaining commercially reasonable physical, administrative and technical
    safeguard to security the Customer Data in the Self-Hosted SaaS Solution from

14. **<U text="BINDING ARBITRATION" />**

In the event of a dispute arising under or relating to this Agreement, the Platform, or
any products or services (each, a "<u>Dispute</u>"), such dispute will be finally and
exclusively resolved by binding arbitration governed by the Federal Arbitration Act
("<u>FAA</u>"). NEITHER PARTY SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIM IN COURT OR
TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL, EXCEPT EITHER PARTY MAY BRING ITS CLAIM IN ITS LOCAL SMALL CLAIMS
COURT, IF PERMITTED BY THAT SMALL CLAIMS COURT RULES AND IF WITHIN SUCH COURT’S 
JURISDICTION.  ARBITRATION IS DIFFERENT FROM COURT, AND DISCOVERY AND APPEAL RIGHTS MAY
ALSO BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION.  All disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator
selected jointly by the parties, whose decision will be final, except for a limited right
of appeal under the FAA.  The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted by JAMS
pursuant to its then current Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in
accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those rules, or, where appropriate, pursuant
to JAMS’ Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures. All applicable JAMS’ rules and
procedures are available at the JAMS website [www.jamsadr.com](https://www.jamsadr.com). Each party
will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees in
accordance with JAMS rules.  Judgment on the arbitrator’s award may be entered in any court
having jurisdiction. This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies
in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.  The arbitration may be
conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. If conducted
in person, the arbitration shall take place in the United States county where you reside. 
The parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay a proceeding pending
arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the
arbitrator.  The parties shall cooperate in good faith in the voluntary and informal exchange
of all non-privileged documents and other information (including electronically stored
information) relevant to the Dispute immediately after commencement of the arbitration. 
Nothing in this Agreement will prevent us from seeking injunctive relief in any court of
competent jurisdiction as necessary to protect our proprietary interests.  

15. **CLASS ACTION WAIVER**

You agree that any arbitration or proceeding shall be limited to the Dispute between us and
you individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (i) no arbitration or proceeding shall
be joined with any other; (ii) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated
or resolved on a class action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (iii) there is
no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on
behalf of the general public or any other persons. YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST
US ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED
CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. 

16. **EQUITABLE RELIEF**

You acknowledge and agree that in the event of a breach or threatened violation of our
intellectual property rights and confidential and proprietary information by you, we will
suffer irreparable harm and will therefore be entitled to injunctive relief to enforce this
Agreement. We may, without waiving any other remedies under this Agreement, seek from any
court having jurisdiction any interim, equitable, provisional, or injunctive relief that is
necessary to protect our rights and property pending the outcome of the arbitration referenced
above. You hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent to the personal and subject matter
jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the State of California for purposes of any
such action by us. 

17. **CONTROLLING LAW; EXCLUSIVE FORUM**

The Agreement and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of
California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.  The Parties hereby consent
and agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in the State
of California for all suits, actions, or proceedings directly or indirectly arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, and waive any and all objections to such courts, including but
not limited to, objections based on improper venue or inconvenient forum, and each party
hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any suits,
actions, or proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement  

18. **FORCE MAJEURE.**

Mirascope will not be deemed to be in breach of this Agreement for any failure or delay in
performance to the extent caused by reasons beyond its reasonable control, including, but
not limited to, acts of God, acts of any governmental body, war, insurrection, sabotage,
armed conflict, terrorism, embargo, fire, flood, strike or other labor disturbance,
COVID-19, quarantine restrictions, freight embargoes, unavailability of or interruption
or delay in telecommunications or third-party services, or virus attacks or hackers
(collectively, "<u>Force Majeure Event</u>"). When such Force Majeure Event arises, Mirascope
shall promptly notify you of its failure to perform, describing the cause of failure and
how it affects performance, and the anticipated duration of the inability to perform. For
the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 18 shall be construed to excuse any payment
obligations hereunder. 

19. **EXPORT CONTROL LAWS.**

Our Platform may be subject to export control laws and regulations of the United States.
You hereby certify that you and your Authorized Users will comply with all U.S. export
control laws and regulations including but not limited to the International Traffic in Arms
Regulations ("ITAR") (22CFR 120-130), Export Administration Regulations ("EAR")
(15CFR 730-774) and regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of
Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC") (31CFR 500598) (collectively, the "**Export Control Laws**").
You and your Authorized Users agree not to, directly or indirectly, use, sell, supply,
export, reexport, transfer, divert, release, or otherwise dispose of the Software and any
products, software, or technology (including products derived from or based on such
technology) received from  Mirascope under this Agreement to any destination, entity, or
person or for any end use prohibited by applicable Export Controls Laws. 

20. **MISCELLANEOUS.**

You may not assign any of your rights, duties, or obligations under these Terms of Service
to any person or entity, in whole or in part, without written consent from Mirascope. Our
failure to act on or enforce any provision of the Agreement shall not be construed as a
waiver of that provision or any other provision in this Agreement.  No waiver shall be
effective against us unless made in writing, and no such waiver shall be construed as a
waiver in any other or subsequent instance.  Except as expressly agreed by us and you in
writing, the Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and us with respect to
the subject matter, and supersedes all previous or contemporaneous agreements, whether
written or oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter. You acknowledge
and agree that there are no third-party beneficiaries under this Agreement. The section
headings are provided merely for convenience and shall not be given any legal import. 
This Agreement will inure to the benefit of our successors, assigns, licensees, and
sublicensees.

# Open-Source

As an open-source project, Lilypad makes it so:

- You can see exactly what's going on under the hood and how it works.
- You can [self-host](/docs/lilypad/getting-started/self-hosting) Lilypad on your own servers and customize it to your heart's content.
- You can [contribute](https://github.com/Mirascope/lilypad/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to the project.

We're excited to see where the community takes it!

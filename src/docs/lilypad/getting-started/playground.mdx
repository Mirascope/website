# Playground

<Success>
  This is a good place for non-technical folks to start using Lilypad
</Success>

The Playground provides a no-code interface for experimenting with different prompts and settings.

Some benefits include:

1. No-code
2. Automatic versioning & tracing
3. Type-safe user interface
4. Hot-swap active version without redeploying (when safe)

## LLM API Key

Navigate to [Settings -> Keys](https://app.lilypad.so/settings/keys) to set the key for the providers you plan on using in the playground.

\[INSERT IMAGE]

We recommend creating one in [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) if you don't have one yet.

They have a very generous free tier.

## Playground Sessions

When creating a new playground session, you'll need to create a new [Versioned Function](/docs/lilypad/observability/versioning) or attach it to an existing one:

\[INSERT IMAGE]

Creating a new versioned function will open a session with the default empty settings. If you select an existing function, the session will be populated with the settings most recently used in the given environment for that function:

\[INSERT IMAGE]

Clicking the "Run" button will execute the session, automatically tracing and versioning it's settings:

## Side-By-Side Sessions

## Running Playground In Code

You can take advantage of Lilypad's [versioning](/docs/lilypad/observability/versioning) to run the playground in your code. This is powered by Mirascope, so you'll need to install some extra dependencies:

<TabbedSection>
<Tab value="uv">
```bash
uv add "lilypad-sdk[playground]"
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="pip">
```bash
pip install "lilypad-sdk[playground]"
```
</Tab>
</TabbedSection>

You can then sync your local stubs with remote:

```bash
lilypad sync
```

This will ensure that the `.version` and `.remote` methods have proper type-hints.

You can then run the specific playground session's version:

```python
response = answer_question.version(3)("What is the capital of France?")
```

or run it as the deployed version:

```python
response = answer_question.remote("What is the capital of France?")
```

If the function has only ever had playground versions (i.e. no original code), you can copy the Mirascope code for a specific function version as the default:

\[INSERT IMAGE]

```python
import lilypad
from mirascope import llm, prompt_template

@lilypad.trace(versioning="automatic")
@llm.call("google", "gemini-2.0-flash-001")
@prompt_template("Answer this question: {question}")
def answer_question(trace_ctx: lilypad.Span, question: str) -> None:
    trace_ctx.metadata({"scope": "playground"})
```

You can then run a specific playground version and default to this version if there's an error:

```python
question = "What is the capital of France?"
try:
    response = answer_question.version(1)(question)
except lilypad.RemoteFunctionError:
    response = answer_question(question)
```

## Opening Playground From Trace

You can open [traces](/docs/lilypad/observability/traces) in the playground if they were generated using the playground. You can easily identify such traces by locating the "playground" scope tag on the trace:

\[INSERT IMAGE]

Opening the trace in the playground will populate the settings with those matching the trace:

\[INSERT IMAGE]

This will open the playground with the settings matching the trace.

# Welcome to Lilypad

Welcome to Lilypad, a framework for building your data flywheel in one line of code.

## What is Lilypad?

Lilypad helps you collect, curate, and evaluate data for your LLM-powered applications. It provides:

- Simple API for data collection
- Tools for data evaluation
- Integration with Mirascope
- Fine-tuning capabilities
- Feedback loops for continuous improvement

## Installation

```bash
npm install @mirascope/lilypad
```

## Quick Example

```typescript
import { DataFlywheel } from "@mirascope/lilypad";

// Create a data flywheel
const flywheel = new DataFlywheel({
  name: "customer-support",
  storage: {
    type: "local",
    path: "./data",
  },
});

// Collect data
await flywheel.collect({
  input: "How do I reset my password?",
  output: "You can reset your password by clicking on the 'Forgot Password' link on the login page.",
  metadata: {
    source: "customer-chat",
    timestamp: Date.now(),
  },
});

// Evaluate data
const evaluations = await flywheel.evaluate({
  evaluator: "helpfulness",
});

console.log(evaluations);
```

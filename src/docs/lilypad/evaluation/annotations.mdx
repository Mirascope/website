# Annotations

When you click on a trace to view more details, there's a panel for annotations.

Click on that to annotate the trace:

You can also navigate to a specific function version and click on the "Annotations" tab to see a table with columns for inputs, output, ideal output, label, and reasoning:

Clicking on an annotation row will open the underlying trace details.

## Exact Match

You can mark a function as exact match. This indicates that you expect the output to have a label that it should match exactly. Once you've entered the exact match for a specific input, any function that is run with that input will have it's ideal output automatically populated with the predefined exact match.

You can view aggregate metrics in the "Annotations" tab for a function version.

## Fuzzy Metrics

When there isn't necessarily an exact output you're looking for, you can provide PASS/FAIL labels with a reason. This can help to better categorize and understand where your functions are failing:

These annotations will prove to be extremely useful for later automating parts of your annotation flow.

We're working on some new tooling called [vibe synthesis](/docs/lilypad/vibe-synthesis) to help with this.

## Annotate In Code

Setting `mode="wrap"` in the `trace` decorator converts the original return type of the decorated function into a `Traced[R]` that provides methods for operating on the corresponding trace directly.

For example, you might want to enable passthrough annotation so that your users can annotate traces directly:

```python
import lilypad

lilypad.configure()

@lilypad.trace(name="Answer Question", versioning="automatic", mode="wrap") 
def answer_question(question: str) -> str | None:
    response = client.models.generate_content(
        model="gemini-2.0-flash-001",
        contents=f"Answer this question: {question}",
    )
    return response.text
    
trace: lilypad.Trace[str | None] = answer_question("What is the capital of France?")
print(trace.response)  # original response
# > The capital of France is Paris.

trace.annotate(label="PASS", reason="The answer was correct")
```

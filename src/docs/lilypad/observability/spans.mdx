None of the tooling below requires LLMs. It is, however, very handy when working with them.

Lilypad implements a `span` context manager that makes it easy to instrument a block of code:

```python
import lilypad

lilypad.configure()

with lilypad.span("Something") as span:
    # do something
    span.log("Did something...")
```

This will automatically capture information such as the latency of the code run within the span, including any calls to `log` that you make inside of the block.

## Logging Levels

The `span` context manager provides additional convenience methods for common logging levels:

* `log` — alias for the `info` method.
* `info` — log an informational message.
* `debug` — log a debug message.
* `warning` — log a warning message.
* `error` — log an error message.
* `critical` — log a critical message.

For example, you may want to catch and log and exception:

```python
import lilypad

lilypad.configure()

with lilypad.span("Possible Failure") as span:
    try:
        # do something that could error
        raise RuntimeError("For testing.")
    except RuntimeError as e:
        span.error(f"Runtime exception caught: {e}")
```

## Metadata

You can also capture arbitrary structured metadata:

```python
import lilypad

lilypad.configure()

with lilypad.span("Structured Metadata") as span:
    span.metadata({"key": "value"})
```

Calling `metadata` multiple times will merge the dictionaries.

## Nested Spans

Lilypad will properly capture nested spans as what we call [Traces](/docs/lilypad/observability/traces), which are really just a collection of nested spans that share a single common parent.

```python
import lilypad

lilypad.configure()

with lilypad.span("Parent Span") as parent_span:
    parent_span.log("I'm the parent!")
    with lilypad.span("Child span") as child_span:
        child_span.log("I'm the child!")
```

The project home page will only display the parent in each row. You can click the dropdown to view the entire collection of spans contained within that trace:

# Welcome to Mirascope

Welcome to Mirascope, a powerful framework for building LLM-powered applications with type safety and simplicity.

## What is Mirascope?

Mirascope provides a set of abstractions that make it easy to work with LLMs in your application. It offers:

- Strong typing for prompts and responses
- Middleware for tracing, retries, and more
- Support for multiple LLM providers
- Simple API for structured outputs
- Integrated tools and agents

## Installation

```bash
npm install @mirascope/sdk
```

## Quick Example

```typescript
import { Prompt } from "@mirascope/sdk";

const SummarizeText = Prompt.create({
  systemPrompt: "You are a helpful AI assistant that summarizes text.",
  userPrompt: "Please summarize the following text: {{text}}",
  responseModel: {
    summary: "A concise summary of the text",
    keyPoints: ["Key points from the text"],
  },
});

async function main() {
  const response = await SummarizeText.call({
    text: "This is a long text that needs to be summarized...",
  });
  
  console.log(response.summary);
  console.log(response.keyPoints);
}
```

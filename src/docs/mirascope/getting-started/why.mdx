## Abstractions That Aren't Obstructions

Mirascope provides powerful abstractions that simplify LLM interactions without hiding the underlying mechanics. This approach gives you the convenience of high-level APIs while maintaining full control and transparency.

### Everything Beyond The Prompt Is Boilerplate

By eliminating boilerplate, Mirascope allows you to focus on what matters most: your prompt.

Let's compare structured outputs using Mirascope vs. the official SDKs:

#### Mirascope API

<ApiStyleCodeBlock 
  mirascopeHeader={true}
  examplePath="mirascope/getting-started/quickstart" 
/>

#### Provider SDK Equivalent

<ProviderCodeBlock 
  examplePath="mirascope/getting-started/quickstart"
  collapsible={false}
  headerText="Official SDK"
/>

Reducing this boilerplate becomes increasingly important as the number and complexity of your calls grows beyond a single basic example. Furthermore, the Mirascope interface works across all of our various supported providers, so you don't need to learn the intricacies of each provider to use them the same way.

### Functional, Modular Design

Mirascope's functional approach promotes modularity and reusability. You can easily compose and chain LLM calls, creating complex workflows with simple, readable code.

The goal of our design approach is to remain **Pythonic** so you can **build your way**.

### Provider-Agnostic When Wanted, Specific When Needed

We understand the desire for easily switching between various LLM providers. We also understand the (common) need to engineer a prompt for a specific provider (and model).

By implementing our LLM API call functionality as decorators, Mirascope makes implementing any and all of these paths straightforward and easy:

#### Provider-Specific

```python
from mirascope.core import anthropic, openai


@openai.call("gpt-4o-mini")
def openai_recommend_book(genre: str) -> str:
    return f"Recommend a {genre} book"


@anthropic.call("claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620")
def anthropic_recommend_book(genre: str) -> str:
    return f"Recommend a {genre} book"


openai_response = openai_recommend_book("fantasy")
print(openai_response.content)

anthropic_response = anthropic_recommend_book("fantasy")
print(anthropic_response.content)
```

#### Provider-Agnostic

```python
from mirascope.core import anthropic, openai, prompt_template


@prompt_template()
def recommend_book_prompt(genre: str) -> str:
    return f"Recommend a {genre} book"


# OpenAI
openai_model = "gpt-4o-mini"
openai_recommend_book = openai.call(openai_model)(recommend_book_prompt)
openai_response = openai_recommend_book("fantasy")
print(openai_response.content)

# Anthropic
anthropic_model = "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620"
anthropic_recommend_book = anthropic.call(anthropic_model)(recommend_book_prompt)
anthropic_response = anthropic_recommend_book("fantasy")
print(anthropic_response.content)
```

## Who Should Use Mirascope?

Mirascope is **designed for everyone** to use!

However, we believe that the value of Mirascope will shine in particular for:

- **Professional Developers**: Who need fine-grained control and transparency in their LLM interactions.
- **AI Application Builders**: Looking for a tool that can grow with their project from prototype to production.
- **Teams**: Who value clean, maintainable code and want to avoid the "black box" problem of many AI frameworks.
- **Researchers and Experimenters**: Who need the flexibility to quickly try out new ideas without fighting their tools.
